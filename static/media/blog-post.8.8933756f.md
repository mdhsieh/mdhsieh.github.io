I'm releasing a new iOS app, Writing Statistics. It's to help improve writing habits and visualize your progress with statistics.

The idea came because I wanted to improve my own writing in personal projects. I wanted something to motivate me to write more, experiment with a more data-driven approach, and see my habits at a glance. Like bar graphs and daily streaks and similar things.

Looking through the App Store I only found one app that did what I had in mind. I figured, why don't I make my own app and get some experience while I'm at it. A bit faster at loading and a bit less expensive and does the job.

Features:
- Daily progress reminder
- Daily word count graph
- Total project progress
- Writing sessions streaks calendar
- Time spent per day, week, or month
- Phases percentages
- Save timed or calendar writing sessions
- Customizable project settings
