My latest app is a custom one originally made for a family member. [BP Averager](https://apps.apple.com/app/blood-pressure-averager/id6739744580) records and tracks your blood pressure. 

She, the family member, needs to monitor herself for high blood pressure. She typically records her readings 2 times a day, 1 in morning and 1 in evening. Each record has both a high and low blood pressure reading, e.g. 140/120. 

When she goes to the doctor, it's helpful to show them her blood pressure history and her average high/low reading over the last 7 days.

Features:
- See today's readings and your 7-day average at a glance
- Record morning and afternoon blood pressure
- Record heart rate too
- Check your history
